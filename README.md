# IPC 144 NOO
This course covers the fundamental principles of computer programming, with an emphasis on problem solving strategies using structured programming techniques. The C programming language, which is widely used and forms the syntactical basis for object-oriented languages such as C++, C#, and Java, is used to introduce problem analysis, algorithm design, and program implementation.

## Workshop 1: Getting Started

In this workshop, I learned:
* to use Visual Studio to code, edit and execute a C-language program
* to login to a remote host using an SSH client
* to transfer source code between a local computer and a remote host using an SFTP client

## Workshop 2: Computations

In this workshop, I learned:
* to declare variables of integral and floating point types
* to code a simple calculation using C operators and expressions
* to accept a numerical value from the user using scanf
* to cast a value from one data type to another

## Workshop 3: Logic

In this workshop, I learned:
* to create a simple interactive program
* to code a decision using a selection construct
* to code repetitive logic using an iteration construct
* to nest a logical block within another logical block

## Workshop 4: Array

In this workshop, I learned:
* to store data of common type using an array structure
* to associate related data using parallel arrays
* to process the elements of an array using an iteration construct
